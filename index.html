					<h2>Fortel's Pizza Den</h2>
					<p>When it comes to Pizza places that I would recommend most Fortel's would be the place. It is the usual St.Louis style of thin crust pizza. They lightly put sauce on the pizza so that it does not overwhelm the flavor. They put a good layer of cheese on top of that. Finally they load up the pizza with the topping of your choice. I also heard that they have a good Cod Sandwich.</p>
					<p>Address: 7932 MacKenzie Rd, St. Louis, MO 63123</p>

					<h2>Hi-Pointe Drive-In</h2>
					<p>If you like a really good burger this would be the place I recommend going to. Not only are their burgers delicious but they have really well seasoned fries as well. You top that off with a good soda or their popular Orange Creamsicle Shake and it makes for a good meal. Depending on the location that you pick there is an option for a drive thru pick up if you order online.</p>
					<p>Address: 1033 McCausland Ave, St. Louis, MO 63117 , (Other Locations Available)</p>

					<h2>Fuzzy's Taco Shop</h2>
					<p>An enjoyable taco place. A good place to go out with your friends to enjoy some taco's and whatever alcoholic beverage of your choice. The unfortunate part of this place is that the taco quality vary base on location.</p>
					<p>Address: 8073 Watson Rd, Webster Groves, MO 63119 , (Other Locations Available)</p>

					<h2>Bellacino's Pizza & Grinders</h2>
					<p>Even though Bellacino's has really good Pizza I always go there for their Grinders. This is another spot that is a good for eating with a group of people. I have been to multiple locations for this place and I have yet to be disappointed.</p>
					<p>Address: 3484 Jeffco Blvd, Arnold, MO 63010 , (Other Locations Available)</p>

					<h2>K-Bop STL</h2>
					<p>I first discovered this place as due to their food truck. It was good enough to go back for seconds on multiple visits to this food truck. If you ever see the food truck near you stop and check it out or go to their restaurant location.</p>
					<p>Address: 6120 Delmar Blvd, St. Louis, MO 63112</p>

					<h2>Zia's On The Hill</h2>
					<p>Another place that I first discovered by their food truck. The chicken parm is always a personal favorite dish to get from Zia's. There are a decent amount of options that you are not able to choose from on the truck so make sure to check out the restaurant location as well.</p>
					<p>Address: 5256 Wilson Ave, St. Louis, MO 63110</p>

					<h2>Sugarfire Smoke House</h2>
					<p>If you want some enjoyable barbeque this is the place to go. One of my favorite things about this place is that some of the sides very by location. One location had some good stuffed bell peppers and another had loaded tater tots that had great flavor to them. Make sure to try out multiple locations and see which one is your favorite.</p>
					<p>Address: 932 Meramec Station Rd, Valley Park, MO 63088 , (Other Locations Available)</p>

					<a name="blueowl"></a>
					<h2>Blue Owl Restaurant & Bakery</h2>
					<p>The Blue Owl is a restaurant but I am talking about the bakery section. They have such a good selection of different deserts. It is a spot for a date location. Even if you have food at one of the other local restaurants you can always finish it with a nice desert from the Blue Owl.</p>
					<p>Address: 6116 2nd St, Kimmswick, MO 63053</p>

				<section>
					<a name="potbelly"></a>
					<h2>Potbelly Sandwich Shop</h2>
					<p>When it comes to places for a good sandwich Potbelly is up there on the list. Not only that they have good soups to go with it. I highly recommend the chicken pot pie soup with whatever sandwich that you decide on. There is also dessert options that you can choose from.</p>
					<p>Address: 12 S Bemiston Ave, Clayton, MO 63105 , (Other Locations Available)</p>

					<h2>Fitz's Root Beer</h2>
					<p>Fitz's is another place to go with a few friends and enjoy some food. The best part of this place is getting their rootbeer in a chilled mug or topping it off with ice cream for a rootbeet float.</p>
					<p>Address: 6605 Delmar Blvd, St. Louis, MO 63130 , (Other Locations Available)</p>
